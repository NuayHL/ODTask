# Hard Work!
### 17th Mar.
Nothing special today... busy preparing the git but always met push failure..
maybe I need focus on detection pipline
### 18th Mar.
The github finally works.. todays section is filling the models.common. 

Some fundamental blocks needs to be carefully built
### 19th Mar.
The darknet53 was built using torch, but it needs to be further test. The next step is building the YOLOv3
